Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 
SELECT 
  COUNT (*) 
From 
  Attribute = 10, 000 
  
ii. Business table = 
SELECT 
  COUNT (*) 
From 
  Business = 10,000 
  
iii. Category table = 
SELECT 
  COUNT (*) 
From 
  Category = 10,000 
  
iv.Checkin table = 
SELECT 
  COUNT (*) 
From 
  Checkin = 10,000
  
v.elite_years table = 
SELECT 
  COUNT (*) 
From

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

I chose to analyze restaurants in Phoenix. Looking at the two groups based on star rating, it looks like the fast food chains have ratings lower than local restaurants chains. Looking at hours we see that the lower rated restaurants have an earlier start time and wider range of hours compared to the later opening times of the nicer rated restaurants.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

 Yes, disregarding the outlier we see with the Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse restaurant we see more reviews towards the lower rated restaurants.       
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Not able to infer much using locational data as they are all located in different areas.

SQL code used for analysis:

Select 
  b.city, 
  h.hours, 
  b.address, 
  b.postal_code, 
  c.category, 
  b.name, 
  b.stars, 
  b.review_count 
from 
  business b 
  INNER JOIN category c on b.id = c.business_id 
  INNER JOIN hours h on c.business_id = h.business_id 
WHERE 
  b.city = 'Phoenix' 
  AND c.category = 'Restaurants' 
GROUP by 
  stars
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
The businesses that are still open have a higher average star rating.          
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
 There are more reviews for businesses that are open than ones that are closed.        
         
SQL code used for analysis:

Select 
  b.is_open, 
  count(b.name), 
  avg(b.stars), 
  count(b.review_count) 
from 
  business b 
WHERE 
  b.name is not NULL 
GROUP BY 
  b.is_open
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
The type of analysis I am going to do is to provide insights as to what makes a good nightclub according to YELP reviewers in order to help aspiring nighclub owners become sucessful in their future and current operations.        
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
The type of data I used was filtering the reviews down to the category of Nightlife and reviewing the reviews themselves and star ratings. Analyzing these metrics would best help come up with key points for the solution.  Due to the low amount of reviews that came up, I refrained from further filtering down using keywords to get the best analysis possible.                     
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

| Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse | Nightlife |   4.0 |       1 | Phoenix    | My husband and I decided to come here for a Saturday date night. When considering our options, we were sold when we saw the bacon board on the menu. It did not disappoint! It was an excellent and delicious start to our nice (giant) dinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The shrimp and grits were simply glorious. I may have preferred grilled or sautéed shrimp, rather than fried, but the other ingredients did a great job of balancing the richness of the fried shrimp and bacon. Marvelous.                                                                                                                      |

I had been particularly looking forward to the turkey, but they had run out (something we weren't told until after the food was delivered and I inquired about it). The hot links were our least favorite - just not our thing, I guess. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the ribs and brisket were definitely the stars, and our favorites by a mile.                                                                              |

That's about as much as I would pay for that dessert - $0 - as it tasted like hot, vaguely-fruity mush with a layer of raw flour on top. Whatever... they don't claim to be dessert experts, so what did I expect? I just know better for next time. ;)                                                                                                                                           |

Just hipster enough to feel cool, but not so much to make you feel uncomfortable if you didn't show up with facial hair or a vintage t-shirt. Service is not as attentive as I would prefer, but most likely due to having too much to do, as opposed to a lack of effort. Everyone was very nice.                                                                                                                                    |

The service was great and quick; we literally could've gotten out of there in 30 minutes, but the vibe was so fresh that we decided to stay for a couple more drinks! Love it!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse | Nightlife |   4.0 |       1 | Phoenix    | This restaurant has the absolute best atmosphere. It starts from the moment you get out of your car and smell the aroma from the smokehouse. From there, it is dark inside which creates a calm homey feeling. The decor is perfect. The food is out of this world! Apple pie moonshine? Just say yes!                                                                                                                                                                              |

It's 2015. It's a Blues Fest in Pittsburgh, not Dade Cunty Florida. Have you ever been to a Steeler game? You cheat all Buddy fans and Blues fans alike. Screw ever coming into your understaffed club again. Im sure Buddy can work around you and entertain Blues fans before this Legend is gone for good. You've lost the plot for sure. |
